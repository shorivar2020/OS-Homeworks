# Operation systems

Some of my homework from Operating Systems

- Example of a bash, a simple string parser, finding link, dir, file performs the appropriate action or error

- Creates two processes (descendants) by calling the fork function (GEN and NSD). 
These descendants will be connected by a pipe so that the standard output of GEN is connected to the standard input of NSD.

- It will read from standard input "commands" in the form of <X> <word> pairs. Then it outputs the string "Thread n: word word word...", word is repeated X times. 
Example work with theards and semafors.

- My version of malloc.
